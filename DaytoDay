Physcial Qubit - Logical Qubit 
- PQ - two-level quantum system such as a superconducting circuit, trapped ion, photon polarization, or quantum dot 
- These qubits can hold superposition and entanglement, but are highly fragile, prone to decoherence, gate errors, and noise 
- LQ - is a fault-tolerant abstraction built from multiple physical qubits through quantum error-correction 
- It behaves like a reliable qubit in computations despite physical errors. Think of it as dozens, hundreds,
