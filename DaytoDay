Physcial Qubit - Logical Qubit 
- PQ - two-level quantum system such as a superconducting circuit, trapped ion, photon polarization, or quantum dot 
- These qubits can hold superposition and entanglement, but are highly fragile, prone to decoherence, gate errors, and noise 
- LQ - is a fault-tolerant abstraction built from multiple physical qubits through quantum error-correction 
- It behaves like a reliable qubit in computations despite physical errors. Think of it as dozens, hundreds, 


Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithm 
 - Quantum Grover's Algorithm [Useful for Searching]
1) Quadratic Advantage of quantum over the Classical Alogrithm 
2) For So Called unstructured search problems 
3) Computational Problem - Unstructrued Search - Searching through the collection of items - isn't sorted and hasn't been ordered in a useful way 
4) Initialization - Grover Operation Iterate Some number of times - finally measurement takes place a candidate solution to the search problem 
Analysis of this operations to better understand what it does and why it's useful for searching 
5) Number of Iteration[Grover Operations] - to maximise the likelihood that the alogrithm succeeds in finding whether it is that we're searching for 
while simultanously minimising the cost
6) Unique Search Problem, which gives exactly one solution for search problem 
7) Multiple solution - What happens when there are multiple Solutions
f sigma n --> sigma 
8) There must be Boolean circuit - polynomial n - Evaluate the function, computing function f, and allow us to evaluate on different input strings 
9) Goal is to find the binary solution x belongs to sigma^n that causes F to evaluate to 1 
10) If Input is in the description of boolean circuit for computing the function f - this is so called, np complete problem 

11) Where and when we think about the problem arise is the 
 and f is computed by boolean circuit.
as we saw in 6th les, we can connect these two points of view through the construction that we went through for taking a boolean circuit and converting it into quantum circuit for 
implementing a query operations or a query gate
12) Input to this problem is function f 
     no solution f turns out to be constant zero function 
13) Searching for the solution to the complicated equation 
14) Searching the combination to open the lock 
it is sensible to think about this problem in the context of the query model regardless of how we might feel about the practical relevance of that model 
of course they aren't oracle or blackboxes in real life but until we learn otherwise complicated & mysterious boolean circuits are kind of like black boxes 
14.1) If we have boolean circuits for the function rather than black box. then we can still run query algorithms on it 
15) Grover's Algorithm Searching Required O(squareroot(N))
    Those Queries happen in superposition
    It's a significant improvement over the classical algorithm 
   Quadratic Advantage 
16) It means that even though quantum computers don’t always give exponential speedups
17) they can still outperform classical computers significantly — especially when - N is very large
18) Many Quantum Algorithm in the query model - naturally expressed using Phase Query Gates
19) Quick Review of Ordinary Query Gates for a function f of the form that we talked about the query gate, query gate Uf is defined on Standard Basis State 
    for superposition of standard basis state the action is determined by linearity 
20) It Automatically kicks the function value into the phase, rather than XORing the output value onto the additional qubit like we have for Uf
21) If we apply the phase quick on Uf gate, we are just implementing the zf gate - This is the Phase Query Gates 
22) If we just given with the phase query gate zf, this is the only to access the function f 
23) OR - Zor gate --> not depends on the function f - it doesn't require any queries

Birth of Quantum Physics

Space
Everyday sense: Space is the "arena" in which objects exist and events happen. It’s the three-dimensional expanse (length, width, height) that gives things their positions and separations.
Physics sense: In Newtonian mechanics, space was seen as an absolute, fixed background — the same for everyone. But in Einstein’s relativity, space is not rigid — it can stretch, curve, and interact with matter and energy.
Time
Everyday sense: Time is the continuous flow of events, what allows us to perceive past, present, and future.
Physics sense: Time is not absolute either. Einstein showed that time can flow differently depending on relative motion and gravity (time dilation). In strong gravity or at high speeds, clocks run at different rates compared to others.

spacetime
Unification: Einstein’s theory of relativity merged space and time into a single four-dimensional entity: spacetime (3 dimensions of space + 1 of time).
Geometry: Matter and energy tell spacetime how to curve, and that curvature tells matter how to move. This is essentially what we call gravity in general relativity.
Example: Light bending around a star or black hole is not being "pulled" — it’s following the straightest possible path (a geodesic) in curved spacetime.

Space = "where" things are.
Time = "when" things happen.
Spacetime = the unified fabric of the universe, where "where" and "when" are inseparable.

Excellent Question 
1.The curvature of spacetime isn’t something we can "see" with our eyes the way we see a bent stick
2.we detect its effects through how matter and light move. Here are the main ways we observe spacetime curvature in action:
Everyday Examples (close to home).
Gravity on Earth
You feel your weight because Earth curves spacetime around it.
What you call "falling" is just following the natural straight path (a geodesic) in curved spacetime.
GPS Satellites
GPS has to account for both Earth’s gravity (general relativity) and motion effects (special relativity).
GPS has to account for both Earth’s gravity (general relativity) and motion effects (special relativity).
Without correcting for spacetime curvature, GPS would be off by kilometers each day.

Astronomical Examples
Gravitational Lensing
Light from a distant galaxy gets bent around a massive object (like another galaxy or black hole) on its way to us.
Telescopes like Hubble have captured these "Einstein rings" — arcs and circles of distorted light that are direct evidence of curved spacetime.

Black Holes
Near a black hole, spacetime is curved so extremely that nothing, not even light, can escape.
The Event Horizon Telescope imaged the shadow of a black hole in 2019 — a direct glimpse of spacetime’s most extreme curvature.

Gravitational Waves
Ripples in spacetime itself, caused by violent events like black hole mergers.
Detected first in 2015 by LIGO, these are literally spacetime stretching and squeezing as they pass through Earth.

Very Very Important 
**You don’t see spacetime itself curving, but you see its effects on motion — how objects fall, how light bends, how time ticks differently.
A classic analogy is the rubber sheet: put a heavy ball (mass) on the sheet, and it curves. A marble rolling nearby follows the curved path, not because it "wants" to curve, but because the sheet tells it to.

Special Relativity (1905)
The setting: no gravity, just motion.
The two big ideas
1.The speed of light is the same for everyone.
No matter how fast you’re moving, if you measure light, it always comes out the same speed. (This was shocking — people thought speeds should add up like cars on a highway.)
2.The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.
There’s no “preferred” frame of reference.



Intuitive consequences
1.Time is flexible. If your friend zooms past you near the speed of light, their clock ticks slower compared to yours. (This is time dilation.)
2.Space is flexible. Objects moving really fast shrink in the direction they’re moving (length contraction).
No universal "now". What you call "simultaneous" might not be simultaneous for someone moving differently.

Analogy:
Imagine reality as a movie. You and your friend might run the same film at different speeds or angles — 
yet the story still makes sense. Special relativity is like discovering that "time" and "space" can stretch and shrink depending on how you watch the movie, but the physics stays consistent.


General Relativity (1915)
The setting: now bring in gravity.
The big idea
Gravity isn’t a force pulling objects. Instead, mass and energy bend spacetime, and objects move along the curves.

Intuitive consequences
Planets orbit the Sun not because the Sun "pulls" them, but because the Sun bends spacetime around it — and planets follow the curved paths.
Light bends around stars or galaxies because spacetime itself is curved.
Time runs slower where gravity is stronger. Near a black hole, seconds pass more slowly than far away.

Analogy:
Think of spacetime as a trampoline. A bowling ball (the Sun) sits on it, making a dent. A marble (Earth) rolls around the dent — not because the bowling ball reaches out and pulls it, but because the surface itself is curved.
Or another analogy: imagine Google Maps navigation. Roads are drawn on a flat map, but in reality, the Earth is curved. Your "straight" route across a globe looks curved on the map. In the same way, straight paths in spacetime (geodesics) look curved to us, but they’re just following the geometry of the universe.

Special Relativity: How space and time behave when things move very fast (near light speed).
General Relativity: How space and time themselves bend and warp in the presence of mass and energy (gravity).


Time runs slower where gravity is stronger.
This is called gravitational time dilation, and it’s part of Einstein’s general relativity.

Concepts involved
Spacetime is curved by mass and energy.
A massive object like a planet or black hole bends spacetime around it.

Time is part of spacetime.
So when spacetime curves, time itself is affected — not just space.

Clocks are physical.
Whether it’s a wristwatch, your heartbeat, or the oscillation of atoms in an atomic clock — all processes of change are slowed by strong gravity.

Relativity of perspective.
An observer far away (weaker gravity) and an observer deep near a massive object (stronger gravity) will disagree on how fast time is passing.

Intuitive ways to think about it
1.The valley analogy (water flow = time flow)
Imagine spacetime like a landscape. Time is like water flowing downhill.
At higher ground (far from gravity), the water flows fast = time ticks faster.
Deep in the valley (strong gravity), the water flows more sluggishly = time ticks slower.
So near a black hole, you’re deep in the valley — time trickles slowly compared to far away.

2.Energy cost of climbing out of gravity.
Think about sending light upward from near a black hole.
The light loses energy climbing out of the strong gravity.
Losing energy = its wavelength stretches = its frequency slows down.
Frequency of light is basically how a "clock" ticks.

So if even light slows down when escaping, everything that "ticks" near a black hole also ticks slower.

3. Movie playback analogy
Imagine you’re watching two movies side by side.
One is playing normally (far from gravity).
The other, filmed near a black hole, looks like it’s in slow motion.

For the person in the slow-motion movie, nothing feels odd — their heartbeat, thoughts, and clock all feel normal. But for you watching from afar, their time runs slow.

4. GPS proof (real-life effect!)
This isn’t just theory. GPS satellites orbiting Earth are farther from Earth’s gravity, so their clocks tick faster than clocks on Earth’s surface.
Engineers must correct for this, or GPS would drift by kilometers daily.

Here’s a simple way to phrase it:
Mass bends spacetime.
Time is part of spacetime.
Where spacetime curves strongly (near big masses), time itself slows down.
From far away, clocks near strong gravity look like they’re ticking slower.


Thought Experiement [let’s do a twin thought experiment step by step. This is the clearest way to really feel gravitational time dilation.]
The Twin Near the Black Hole

Step 1 — Setup
Imagine you and your twin are together with identical atomic clocks.
You (Twin A) stay far away, floating safely where gravity is weak.
Your twin (Twin B) carefully hovers near the edge of a black hole (but not crossing the event horizon).
Both of you start your clocks at 0 seconds.


Step 2 — What happens from your perspective (far away)?
You look at your twin’s clock.
To you, their clock seems to tick slower.
Example: while your clock advances 10 seconds, theirs advances maybe 5 seconds.
Their voice, their heartbeat, even their waving hand — everything appears in slow motion.


Step 3 — What happens from your twin’s perspective (near the black hole)?
They check their own watch, their pulse, their thinking.
To them, everything feels normal. Their heart beats once per second, just as usual.
If they look at you, far away in weaker gravity, they see your clock ticking faster than theirs.


Step 4 — Reunion
Suppose your twin leaves the black hole region and comes back to you.
You compare clocks.
You find: your twin has aged less than you.
Example: You might have aged 1 year, while they only aged a few weeks.


This isn’t illusion — their body, their cells, their atoms have actually experienced less passage of time.

How to phrase it simply
Inside strong gravity, time itself runs slower.
To the person inside, nothing feels strange.
But when you compare later, the one who was in stronger gravity has lived through less time.

SpaceTime 
deep connection between relativity, the speed of light, and frames of reference. Let’s take it carefully and intuitively:
The speed of light, c, is not just about light. It’s the cosmic speed limit and the conversion factor between space and time.

Light defines the structure of spacetime.
1.Light always travels at the same speed, no matter who measures it.
2.That means light rays are the “yardsticks” of spacetime geometry.
3.When gravity bends spacetime, it bends light paths too, so we detect curvature by seeing how light is delayed, redshifted, or bent.

Light connects space and time.
1.Imagine spacetime as a fabric. The slope of that fabric — how space and time stretch relative to each other — is measured by how light moves.
2.If time slows down near gravity, we can see it because light waves from there get stretched (redshifted) as they climb out.

Nothing can outrun light.
Since light is the maximum speed, it anchors what is possible for clocks, signals, and causes/effects.
So when we say "time slows near a black hole," it’s always measured relative to how light itself propagates between observers.

Analogy: Think of light like the "grid lines" on a map. Even if the terrain bends (curved spacetime), the grid gives you a consistent way to measure distance and direction.

What is a frame of reference?
A frame of reference is just the “point of view” or “coordinate system” you use to describe motion and events.

Everyday example:
Sitting on a train: you can say you’re at rest and the ground moves backward.
From the ground’s frame: the train is moving forward and the ground is still.
Both are valid frames of reference.

In relativity:
A frame of reference includes both space and time.
Observers in different frames can disagree on when events happen or how long they take — but the speed of light is the same in all frames.


In gravity (general relativity):
Near a massive body, your "frame" is inside curved spacetime.
Far away, another observer’s "frame" is in less curved spacetime.
Because frames are curved differently, you disagree about the flow of time.

Analogy:
Imagine two people trying to measure distances on Earth: one using a flat map, one using a globe.
On the flat map, "straight" looks different than on the globe.
Both are correct in their own frame, but the geometry underneath is different.
That’s exactly how frames of reference work in relativity: different perspectives, all internally consistent, but stitched together by the universal rules of spacetime (with light as the "ruler").

The speed of light is the anchor of spacetime — it defines how space and time are connected.
A frame of reference is simply the perspective from which you measure motion, distance, and time — and in relativity, different frames literally experience time differently.


Everyday intuition (before Einstein)
Normally, we expect speeds to add up.
Example: You’re in a car moving at 60 km/h.
You throw a ball forward at 20 km/h.
A person standing on the road sees the ball moving at 80 km/h.
This is called Galilean relativity — the old, everyday rule.


Einstein’s strange discovery
Light doesn’t behave like the ball.
Imagine your car is moving at 60 km/h.
You turn on your headlights.
You measure the light beam: it goes at 300,000 km/s.
A person on the road measures it too: they also get 300,000 km/s — not 300,000 + 60.
⚡ No matter how fast you’re moving, or in what direction, everyone measures light at the same speed.


What does this mean for frames of reference?
A frame of reference = your “point of view” for measuring space and time.
Einstein found: the laws of physics (including the speed of light) are the same in all frames.
So if the speed of light can’t change, then something else must give way… and that “something” is space and time themselves.

Intuitive consequences
----------------------
Time dilation:
To keep light speed constant, moving clocks must tick slower compared to a resting observer.    Why ? Important**
Length contraction:
To keep light speed constant, moving lengths must shrink along the direction of motion.         Why ? Important** 
Relativity of simultaneity:
Observers in different frames don’t agree on what “at the same time” means.                     Why ? Important** 



Analogy: Waves on a cosmic ocean
Imagine light as ripples on a universal ocean.
No matter how fast you swim across it, the ripples spread at the same speed relative to you.
That means the “ocean” (spacetime) must adjust how you experience distance and time so the ripples always keep the same pace.


So when we say “the speed of light is the same in all frames”, it means:                                                
No observer can ever measure light as faster or slower than c.                                 
Instead, the fabric of reality (space and time) bends and adjusts to protect that rule.         
This adjustment is what creates time dilation, length contraction, and the whole of relativity.



it’s the cleanest way to see why time itself has to stretch to keep the speed of light constant.
The Light Clock Thought Experiment
Step 1 — A clock made of light
Imagine a very simple clock:
Two mirrors, one on top of the other.
A photon of light bounces up and down between them.
Every "tick" is when the photon hits the bottom mirror.

So the time this clock measures depends on how long light takes to bounce.

Step 2 — Clock at rest
If the clock is sitting still (your frame):
The photon just goes straight up and down.
Let’s say it takes 1 second for one tick.

This is your “normal” passage of time.

Step 3 — Clock in motion
Now imagine the same clock is moving sideways (say, on a spaceship zooming past you).
To you, watching from the outside, the photon doesn’t go straight up and down anymore.

Instead, it travels in a diagonal zigzag path (because the mirrors are moving while the photon bounces).
So the photon covers more distance per tick.

Step 4 — The catch
But the photon can’t go faster than the speed of light.
So if the distance is longer but the speed is the same…
The only way for the photon to complete each bounce is if the ticks take longer.

In other words: the moving light clock runs slow.

The “Why?”
So the logic is:
Light speed is fixed for everyone.
In a moving frame, the light’s path gets longer (zigzag instead of straight).
Light can’t move faster to make up the difference.
Therefore, time itself must stretch so the clock still works consistently.
This stretching of time is time dilation.

Very Very Important
Imagine dribbling a basketball straight up and down while standing still — fast and easy.
Now try dribbling while running sideways — the ball’s path is longer (diagonal), so each bounce takes longer, even though the ball’s speed hasn’t changed.
That’s exactly what happens with light in a moving clock.

The constancy of the speed of light forces time to adjust.
That’s why moving clocks must tick slower compared to resting ones.

Part 1: Gravity and Time (extension of the light clock)
Light climbing out of gravity
Imagine shining a light upward from near Earth (or worse, a black hole).
As it climbs, it has to "work against gravity".

It doesn’t speed up or slow down (light always travels at c), but it loses energy.
Lower energy = lower frequency = slower ticking of that "light clock".

So: clocks deeper in gravity run slower relative to those far away.
Analogy: Throwing a ball upward. The ball loses kinetic energy as it climbs. For light, the "loss" shows up as stretched-out ticks. That’s why time flows more slowly in strong gravity.

Part 2: Length Contraction (why space shrinks)
We already saw why time dilates. But that alone isn’t enough — relativity is symmetric: each observer must agree that their light speed measurement is the same. That forces space to adjust too.
The ship is moving, so the light has to "catch up" with the front of the ship.
If the ship’s length were the same as when it was at rest, light would take too long to reach the front — it would look like light is slower than c.

Step 3 — The fix
To prevent this contradiction, the ship’s length in the direction of motion must shrink from your perspective.
That way, light still crosses the ship at exactly speed c.

Step 4 — The symmetry
Inside the ship, astronauts feel nothing strange. Their meter sticks and clocks seem normal.
Outside, you see their moving clocks tick slower and their moving ship shorter.
This mutual adjustment keeps the speed of light identical for both observers.

Analogy for Length Contraction
Imagine you’re timing a runner on a track. If you insist the runner’s speed must stay constant, but your stopwatch is running slow (time dilation), then the only way the math balances is if the track length also looks shorter.

That’s what nature does: it bends both time and space together to preserve light’s constancy.

In Summary
Time dilation: Moving clocks tick slower (from an outside perspective).
Length contraction: Moving distances shrink along the direction of motion.
Reason: Both are necessary so that every observer, in every frame, always measures light at exactly c.

Analogy for Length Contraction

In Summary
Time dilation: Moving clocks tick slower (from an outside perspective).
Length contraction: Moving distances shrink along the direction of motion.
Reason: Both are necessary so that every observer, in every frame, always measures light at exactly c.

Now, do you want me to draw this all together into one clear story — showing how time, space, and light speed are linked, leading to the idea of spacetime? That’s the "big aha" moment.


The Big Story: Time, Space, and Light Speed → Spacetime
-------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 — Light as the ruler
The speed of light is the same for everyone.
That means light is like the yardstick of the universe: it defines what "distance" and "duration" mean.


Step 2 — Time dilation (clearer intuition)
With the light clock, we saw that moving observers see diagonal photon paths.
To keep light at c, moving clocks must tick slower. ✅ That’s intuitive now.

Step 3 — Where length contraction enters
Now imagine a different light clock:
This time, the photon bounces front-to-back along the spaceship.
Inside the ship, astronauts measure: light goes forward and back at speed c, no problem.
But from the outside, the ship is moving. The front of the ship is running away from the photon, and the back is rushing toward it.
⚡ If the ship kept its normal rest length, you (outside) would measure light going slower or faster than c — which is impossible.


So the only fix is:
👉 To you, the moving ship shortens in the direction of motion.
That way, light still covers the correct distance at speed c.

If the ship kept its normal rest length, you (outside) would measure light going slower or faster than c — which is impossible.

So the only fix is:
👉 To you, the moving ship shortens in the direction of motion.
That way, light still covers the correct distance at speed c.

Step 4 — Symmetry between time & space
If time alone changed, we’d break light’s constancy in the front-to-back experiment.
If space alone changed, we’d break it in the up-down zigzag experiment.
The universe balances both:
Time slows down.
Length contracts.
Together, they ensure light speed stays the same in all frames.

Deeper Analogy for Length Contraction
Imagine reality is like a fabric being stretched diagonally.
To one observer, the "horizontal threads" (space) look shorter.
To another, the "vertical threads" (time) look stretched.
Both are seeing the same underlying fabric (spacetime), just from different angles.
So: length contraction isn’t a trick of vision, it’s the geometry of spacetime.

The Big Aha
Space and time are not independent. They are woven into one fabric: spacetime.
Different observers "slice" this fabric differently depending on how they move.
What looks like slower time to one observer also looks like shorter space to another.
The speed of light is the rule that ties it all together — the slope of spacetime’s geometry.

So, length contraction feels mysterious because we still think of space and time as separate. But once you treat them as one thing (spacetime), it’s not weird: different observers are just cutting the same fabric at different angles.

Would you like me to show you a spacetime diagram (with light cones) so you can actually see how different observers’ slices give time dilation and length contraction naturally?

Great choice 🙌 — spacetime diagrams are the way to see why time dilation and length contraction are two sides of the same coin. I can make a simple one for you. But before I draw, let me explain the picture so it clicks when you see it.

The Spacetime Diagram (Intuition First)

Axes
Vertical axis = time (t)
Horizontal axis = space (x, one direction only for simplicity)
Every point on the diagram = an event (a place and a time).

Light Cones
Light always moves at the same speed (c).
On the diagram, this shows up as lines at 45° (since in 1 second, light moves 1 "light-second" of distance).
These 45° lines form a cone: the region inside is the possible future/past for anything slower than light.

Observers
An observer at rest = a vertical line (they stay at the same x position, just moving through time).
A moving observer = a tilted line (they move through both space and time).


The magic
Here’s the key:
Both observers must agree that light stays at 45°.
To make that happen, the moving observer’s "grid of time and space" tilts.
Their time axis tilts → their clocks tick slower (time dilation).
Their space axis tilts → their lengths shrink (length contraction).
So: it’s not that time alone or space alone changes — both tilt together. That tilt is literally what relativity is.


Once you see the diagram, it becomes clear:
Everyone agrees on the speed of light (the 45° slope).
But different observers carve up spacetime differently, which gives rise to time dilation and length contraction.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6))

# Axes: time vertical, space horizontal
ax.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=1)
ax.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=1)
ax.set_xlabel("Space (x)")
ax.set_ylabel("Time (t)")

# Light cone lines (speed of light = 45°)
x = [0, 1]
t = [0, 1]
ax.plot(x, t, 'r--', label="Light path (c)")
ax.plot([-1, 0], [1, 0], 'r--')

# Rest observer (vertical worldline)
ax.plot([0, 0], [0, 1], 'b-', linewidth=2, label="Observer at rest")

# Moving observer (tilted worldline)
ax.plot([0, 0.6], [0, 1], 'g-', linewidth=2, label="Moving observer")

# Labels and legend
ax.legend(loc="upper left")
ax.set_xlim(-1.2, 1.2)
ax.set_ylim(0, 1.2)
ax.set_title("Spacetime Diagram: Light Cones and Observers")

plt.show()

Here’s the spacetime diagram 🌌:

Red dashed lines (45°) = light paths (always the same slope, no matter the observer).

Blue vertical line = observer at rest (just moving through time, not space).

Green tilted line = moving observer (moving through both time and space).

👉 To keep light fixed at 45°, the moving observer’s axes tilt. That’s why:

Their time ticks slower (time dilation).

Their lengths shrink along motion (length contraction).

Would you like me to add the tilted “grid” of the moving observer (their x′ and t′ axes) so you can see how space and time both bend together?
