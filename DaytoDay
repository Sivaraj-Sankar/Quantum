Physcial Qubit - Logical Qubit 
- PQ - two-level quantum system such as a superconducting circuit, trapped ion, photon polarization, or quantum dot 
- These qubits can hold superposition and entanglement, but are highly fragile, prone to decoherence, gate errors, and noise 
- LQ - is a fault-tolerant abstraction built from multiple physical qubits through quantum error-correction 
- It behaves like a reliable qubit in computations despite physical errors. Think of it as dozens, hundreds, 


Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithm 
 - Quantum Grover's Algorithm [Useful for Searching]
1) Quadratic Advantage of quantum over the Classical Alogrithm 
2) For So Called unstructured search problems 
3) Computational Problem - Unstructrued Search - Searching through the collection of items
4) Grover Operation Iterate Some number of times - finally measurement takes place a candidate solution to the search problem 
5) Number of Iteration - to maximise the likelihood that the alogrithm succeeds in finding whether it is that we're searching for 
while simultanously minimising the cost
6) Unique Search Problem, which gives exactly one solution for search problem 
7) Multiple solution - What happens when there are multiple Solutions
f sigma n --> sigma 
8) There must be Boolean circuit - polynomial n 
9) Goal is to find the binary solution x belongs to sigma^n
10) If Input is in the description of boolean circuit for computing the function f - this is so called, np complete problem 

11) Where and when we think about the problem arise is the 
 and f is computed by boolean circuit.
12) Input to this problem is function f 
     no solution f turns out to be constant zero function 
13) Searching for the solution to the complicated equation 
14) Searching the combination to open the lock
